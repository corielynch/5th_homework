# 5th_homework
This is a daily planner, calendar for homework 5.

I used bootstrap to download a table grid to input the date, input field, and save function for each of the 8 hours of a typical day 9am-5pm. I then used the functinoality of the event delegation activity to save the infomation added to the calendar. The information added to the planner is still saved to localStorage by clicking the blue save button to the right of each input field. 

Using the CDN from moment.js, I could use the moment function to attach each hour to real time. I then color coded each hour of the day to be gray = past hours, red = current hour, and green = future hours. Bootstrap also allows for responsiveness from mobile to large desktop sized screens.
